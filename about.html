							<p>
							The Hidden Primary School was established on Janurary 1st 1989. The founder was a Japanese General, Akira Oda, who lived in a poor village surrounded by trees. After serving his country for 25 years, he decided to open a school. As he believed the children of the village will be the future leaders of the country.

                                <h3>The Leaf</h3>

							<p>
							Why the Leaf? The leaf is a representation of the village which the General spent his youth in. The children wear it proudly as they come in with their uniform. The logo was designed also by the General, as it is a reminder of how far the school has come over the years, since the village.</p>
